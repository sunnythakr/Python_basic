# Given a sorted array A[] of size N, delete all the duplicated elements 
# from A[]. Modify the array such that if there are X distinct elements in
#  it then the first X positions of the array should be filled with them in 
# increasing order and return the number of distinct elements in the array.

# N = 5
# Array = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
# Output: [2]
# Explanation: After removing all the duplicates 
# only one instance of 2 will remain.
