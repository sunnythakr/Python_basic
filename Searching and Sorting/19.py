# Given an integer x, find the square root of x. 
# If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).
# Input:
# x = 5
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect 
# square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.

            # If the square of mid is less than or equal to x, update the result and search in the right half
